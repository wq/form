[![@wq/form][logo]][docs]

**@wq/form** provides a schema-based form layout library with bindings for the React web environment as well as as React Native / Expo.
@wq/form provides a consistent API in both environments, reducing the need for project-specific ".native.js" implementations.

The actual bindings for each environment are provided by [@wq/form-web] and [@wq/form-native], either or both of which should be installed in addition to @wq/form.
