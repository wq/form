[![@wq/form][logo]][docs]

**@wq/form** provides a complete set of form components with a schema-driven layout and full geospatial support.  @wq/form supports the [React] web environment as well as [React Native] and [Expo].  @wq/form provides a consistent API in all three environments, reducing the need for project-specific ".native.js" implementations.

The actual bindings for each environment are provided by [@wq/form-web][installation] and [@wq/form-native][installation], either or both of which should be installed in addition to @wq/form.
